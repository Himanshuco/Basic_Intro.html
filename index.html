    <h1>HTML: The Foundation of the World Wide Web</h1>
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>HTML, which stands for HyperText Markup Language, is the core language used to create web pages. Every website on the internet, from simple blogs to complex web applications, relies on HTML to structure its content. It allows developers to organize text, images, links, and multimedia in a way that browsers can understand and display correctly.</p>
    <q><strong>HTML is the skeleton of every website; without it, the web would have no structure.</strong></q>
    <h2>What HTML Is and How It Works</h2>
    <p>HTML is not a programming language; instead, it is a markup language. This means it uses predefined tags to describe how content should appear on a webpage. These tags instruct the browser on where headings should appear, how paragraphs are formed, and how links connect one page to another. When a browser reads an HTML file, it interprets the tags and renders the content visually for users.</p>
    <h2>Structure of an HTML Document</h2>
    <p>An HTML document follows a clear and logical structure. It begins by declaring the document type, which helps the browser identify the version of HTML being used. The document is divided into two main sections: the head and the body. The head contains information such as the page title and metadata, while the body holds the actual content that users see, including text, images, and links.</p>
    <h2>Why HTML Is Important</h2>
    <p>HTML is essential because it forms the backbone of web development. It ensures that content is accessible across different devices and browsers. HTML also works seamlessly with CSS for styling and JavaScript for interactivity, making it possible to build modern, dynamic websites. Without HTML, the structure and presentation of web content would not be possible.</p>
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>HTML plays a vital role in shaping the internet as we know it today. It provides the basic structure for web pages and allows information to be shared globally in a consistent format. Understanding HTML is the first step toward learning web development, and it remains a fundamental skill for anyone interested in creating or managing websites.</p>
